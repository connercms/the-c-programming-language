A repository containing projects completed while working through the K&R book The C Programming Language.

The examples directory contains code found throughout the chapters that I copied in order to debug and understand how they work.

The misc directory contains C projects not necessarily related to the book but that I didn't want to create a separate repository for, e.x. the client/server UDP & TCP socket programming projects assigned in Computer Networking: A Top Down Approach.
